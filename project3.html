<h1>Time Series Forecast on Sunspot Activity</h1>

<section>
    <h2>Motivation</h2>
    <p>
        This project was inspired by the fascinating patterns observed in the sunspot activity recorded over centuries.
        Sunspots, which are regions on the Sun's surface that appear darker due to lower temperatures, have been closely
        linked to solar phenomena that can have significant impacts on earth. Understanding and forecasting these activities
        can aid in preparing for solar events that affect satellite communications, weather patterns, and even power grids.

    <h2>Packages Used</h2>
    <p>The analysis and forecasting were powered by several key Python packages:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>NumPy for efficient numerical computations.</li>
        <li>Pandas for handling the dataset.</li>
        <li>Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization.</li>
        <li>Scikit-learn for implementing machine learning algorithms.</li>
        <li>TensorFlow and Keras for deep learning models including LSTM and RNN.</li>
        <li>XGBoost for gradient boosting models.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Method</h2>
    <p>
        The project employs a comparative approach, utilizing various machine learning and deep learning techniques
        to forecast sunspot activity. Each model, including GNN, LSTM, RNN, and XGBoost, was trained on historical
        sunspot data, evaluated for accuracy, and fine-tuned for optimal performance.

    <h2>Results</h2>
    <p>
        The comparative analysis revealed that while each model brought unique strengths to the forecasting task,
        the LSTM model demonstrated a superior balance of accuracy and efficiency. Detailed results and model
        comparisons are presented, showcasing the predictive capabilities and potential areas for improvement.
